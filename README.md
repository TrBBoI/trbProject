# trbProject
#### Description
This is my project respository. I intend to use this to share codes that I have written. I hope through sharing these codes I am able to improve myself futher. Most of the code here I intend to write are in C++. 

I am still quite new to git. I hope I can make the best use of it to share and improve. Let see how it goes. 

#### About me
I am Tan Zhe Xing from Singapore.
I am a young game programmer, graduated from collage so long ago. I love games since young. My love on video games have inspired me to strive towards making games that are of equal, if not better, quality. I wish to give players unique and fun experience out of playing games. I hope that there will be one such game with my name in the credit. Until then, I will continue to work hard to improve my practical skills and technical knowledge.

I am a junior game programmer, graduated from Digipen Institute of Technology Singapore in 2014.
