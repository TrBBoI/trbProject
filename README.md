#### Description
This is my project respository. I intend to use this to share codes that I have written. I hope through sharing these codes I am able to improve myself futher. Most of the code here I intend to write are in C++. 

I am still quite new to git. I hope I can make the best use of it to share and improve. Let see how it goes.
